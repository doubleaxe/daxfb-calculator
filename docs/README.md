# Calculator/Factory Builder for factory management games

# General usage

Calculator can work in two modes: `Drag and Drop mode` and `Point and Click mode`.
First can be used on PC only and will not work on touchscreen mobile devices.
Second is optimized for mobile devices, but may be used also on PC.
Modes may be switched on and off using `Options` dialog.

## Drag and Drop mode

In this mode everything is dragged by primary mouse button.
Note: if both `Drag and Drop` and `Point and Click` modes are enabled,
there will be delay between mouse button is pressed on item and dragging actually starts.
This is done to differentiate `Click` and `Drag`.
